  about_1: This plugin can import/Export data from XML format project management files which were created by Microsoft Project.
  about_2: Task names are generated from the name of each XML file task.  Assigned work time in the XML data is converted to project durations in hours, mathematically rounded to two decimal places if need be. Task codes are created from the current date and the task ID, this being typically directly related to position in which the task is listed in most graphical project plan editors. Tasks are imported including all dependency data.
  about_3: To import tasks, choose an XML file stored locally on your computer using the button below, then use the "Analyse" button to upload the file. Please be patient - XML project files can be very large and may take a while to upload and analyse. You can GZip the XML file and upload that instead to save on upload time if you are working with low bandwidth.
  about_4: When analysis is complete, a summary of the tasks that have been found will be presented, allowing you to control exactly which tasks are imported.
  about_analyzed: The tasks found in the file are listed below. Only items with a ticked check box next to them will be imported. Once happy with your selection, use the  "Import selected issues" button to begin the import process. To abandon the import, use the "Back" link.
